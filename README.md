# Ruby Clojure Shell

A ruby gem to dynamically convert Ruby to Clojure, to evaluate within a Clojure nREPL.

## Overview

The general idea here is to allow connecting to a Clojure nREPL session in a python shell. All the python
code will be converted to Clojure and evaluated inside the remote REPL session. Ruby data will be converted
to EDN before passing to the REPL. This allows you to mix together remote Clojure data and local ruby data.
Also, code is automatically converted from snake_case in ruby to snake-case/camelCase in Clojure, since those
are the preferred conventions. 

**Note**: This is alpha software and any interfaces are subject to change.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby_clojure_shell'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby_clojure_shell

## Starting the nREPL

You can start the nREPL as you choose, but simplest way is with [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org)

    lein repl :headless :port 7888

If you start from within a Leiningen project, all the code should be accessible in the shell.

## Shell Usage

To use the rbclj-shell, there are some built in functions for easy REPL use:

### Auto imports

All of the vars from the clojure.core and clojure.repl namespaces have been auto-imported into the shell session. You
can refer to them directly by their name. The unsupported characters such as !, ?, etc. have been mangled.

For those names that conflicted with ruby's built-in module, you'll have to refer to them via the clj or repl namespace
aliases.

```ruby
>>> mapcat # This function has no ruby equivalent, so it's auto imported
#object[clojure.core$mapcat 0x221dbc0a "clojure.core$mapcat@221dbc0a"]

>>> map
<built-in function map>

>>> clj.map
#object[clojure.core$map 0x52b28bf6 "clojure.core$map@52b28bf6"]
```  

### require

Require a clojure namespace and assign to a ruby variable:

```ruby
>>> s = require('clojure.string')
>>> s.upper_case('foo')
FOO
```

### var

Define a clojure var, or get a reference to existing var:

```ruby
>>> my_range = var('my_range', range(100))
#'user/my_range
>>> plus = var('+')
>>> clj.reduce(plus, my_range) # Must explicitly mention Clojure's reduce
4950
```

### new

Instantiate a java class:

```ruby
>>> my_map = new('java.util.HashMap')
#'user/G__765
>>> my_map.put('foo', 'bar')
None
>>> my_map
{u'foo': u'bar'}
```

### import_class

Import a java class so it can be referenced by short name:

```ruby
>>> import_class('java.util.HashMap')
u'java.util.HashMap'
>>> my_map = new('HashMap')
>>> my_map.put('foo', 'bar')
>>> my_map
{u'foo': u'bar'}
```

### doc

Look up the docstring for a clojure var:

```ruby
>>> doc(frequencies)

clojure.core/frequencies

([coll])

  Returns a map from distinct items in coll to the number of times
  they appear.

None
```

### Using repl results locally

When using any of the above functions, the shell automatically evaluates the result when the shell calls repr(). If
you want to use a remote result in a local ruby computation, you need to explicitly call eval():

```ruby
>>> clj.mapv(clj[:inc], clj.range(5, 10)) + [1, 2, 3]
No matching method _PLUS_ found taking 1 args for class clojure.lang.PersistentVector

>>> clj.mapv(clj[:inc], clj.range(5, 10)).eval + [1, 2, 3]
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3]
``` 

## Cli Options

```
usage: rbclj-shell [-h] [--host [host]] [-p [port]]

Run a ruby shell connecting to a Clojure nREPL

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host [host]         Host of running clojure nREPL (default localhost)
  -p [port], --port [port]
                        Port of running clojure nREPL (default 7002)
```
